# Cortex

Tell me why schools need to have 5 different places to assign work, and professors who cannot use LMS systems to their fullest potential, why can it be more organized? We cannot change the schools or the professors, but we can leverage our brains to develop tools that let us do just that.

Meet Cortex, an AI-powered workflow and agent designed to act as a **second brain for students**.  
Its purpose is to automate the learning workflow by understanding lecture material, tracking assignments, and integrating seamlessly into productivity tools students already use.

## 🚀 Vision
Cortex aims to give students a personal AI partner that:
- **Listens to lectures** → Automatically transcribes and summarizes recorded lectures.  
- **Tracks deadlines** → Detects assignments and tests, integrating them into a Notion database.  
- **Keeps you on track** → Connects with a Discord bot to send smart reminders, including:
  - When a new lecture summary is ready.
  - When an upcoming deadline is at risk of being missed.  

Future goals include turning Cortex into a **fully functional AI Agent** that:
- Learns your habits and academic patterns.
- Analyzes grades and performance to identify areas of improvement.
- Suggests personalized study strategies to help you succeed.

## ✨ Features (Work in Progress)
- 📚 **Lecture Intelligence**: Reads and summarizes lecture recordings automatically.  
- 📝 **Deadline Management**: Scrapes assignment/test deadlines and syncs them with Notion.  
- 🤖 **Discord Integration**: Notifies you when new summaries or deadlines are detected.

## 🔮 Roadmap
- [X] Automatic transcript retrieval from lecture platforms (e.g., Panopto, Moodle).  
- [ ] Notion API integration for real-time task and deadline updates.  
- [ ] Discord bot for personalized notifications and reminders.  
- [ ] AI-driven academic insights (study recommendations, grade improvement strategies).  
- [ ] Adaptive learning agent that understands your habits over time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI)  
- **AI/ML**: LLMs for summarization + classification  
- **Database**: Notion API
- **Integrations**:  
  - Notion (assignments, deadlines, tasks)  
  - Discord Bot (notifications & summaries)  
- **Future Expansion**: Real-time agent learning and personalization

## 📌 Status
Cortex is in **active development**.  
This repo is the starting point for building an AI agent that bridges the gap between lecture content, productivity tools, and real-time academic support.
